# AWS Debugging: Aurora Serverless Postgres Upgrade Failure

## Issue Summary
After upgrading **Aurora Serverless Postgres** from **v13 to v14**, the cluster fails with the error:

```
ERROR: Extension incompatible: some_extension v1.3 not compatible with Postgres v14
```

## Potential Reasons for Failure
1. **Incompatible Extension Version**  
   - The extension **some_extension v1.3** is not designed for Postgres v14.  
   - Some extensions require specific Postgres internal APIs that may have changed in v14.  

2. **Aurora’s Extension Support Limitations**  
   - Not all PostgreSQL extensions are supported in **Amazon Aurora**.  
   - AWS may provide a modified version of an extension that is different from the open-source variant.  

3. **PostgreSQL System Catalog Changes**  
   - Certain database objects and functions may have been modified, affecting extensions.  

4. **Schema or Data Type Conflicts**  
   - Extensions modifying system tables or using deprecated types may cause compatibility issues.

## Step-by-Step Debugging Process (AWS Best Practices)

### Step 1: Identify the Installed Extensions and Their Versions
Use the following query to list all installed extensions:

```sql
SELECT name, default_version, installed_version FROM pg_available_extensions;
```

Check the **installed_version** for `some_extension` and verify its compatibility with Postgres v14.

### Step 2: Review AWS Aurora PostgreSQL Release Notes
Since Aurora PostgreSQL **does not support all community extensions**, check:
- [AWS Aurora PostgreSQL release notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.html)  
- [Aurora PostgreSQL extension support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Extensions.html)  

### Step 3: Upgrade or Replace the Extension
If the extension **supports an upgrade**, run:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION some_extension UPDATE TO '1.4';
```

If the extension **is not supported in Aurora Postgres v14**, consider:
- **Finding an alternative** extension.  
- **Removing the extension** before upgrading:  

  ```sql
  DROP EXTENSION some_extension CASCADE;
  ```

### Step 4: Test the Upgrade in a Staging Environment
**AWS Best Practice**: Always test Aurora PostgreSQL upgrades in a staging environment before applying them to production.

- **Create a snapshot** of your Aurora v13 cluster.  
- Restore the snapshot to a test Aurora instance.  
- Perform the upgrade on the test instance and validate all queries.  

### Step 5: Minimise Downtime Using AWS Best Practices
To avoid production impact, follow **AWS-recommended upgrade strategies**:

#### ✅ Option 1: Use a Blue-Green Deployment Strategy
- Deploy a **new Aurora v14 cluster** alongside the existing v13 cluster.  
- Gradually shift **read traffic** to v14.  
- Once stable, shift **write traffic** to v14.  

#### ✅ Option 2: Use Amazon RDS Read Replicas for Zero-Downtime Upgrades
- **Create a read replica** of the **v13 cluster**.  
- **Upgrade the read replica** to **v14**.  
- **Promote the replica** to primary if validation is successful.  

#### ✅ Option 3: In-Place Upgrade with Failover *(Higher Risk)*
- Perform a **multi-AZ upgrade** during low-traffic hours.  
- Use **Aurora failover mechanisms** to switch to a standby instance in case of issues.  

### Step 6: Implement a Rollback Plan
In case of failure, use **AWS rollback strategies**:
1. **Revert to a pre-upgrade snapshot**.  
2. **Use AWS Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** to restore the last stable version.  
3. **Manually drop the extension**, retry the upgrade, and then reinstall a compatible version.

## Final Recommendations (AWS Best Practices)
✅ **Always verify extension compatibility** before upgrading Aurora PostgreSQL.  
✅ **Use Blue-Green Deployments or Read Replicas** to ensure zero downtime.  
✅ **Test upgrades in a staging environment** before applying them to production.  
✅ **Monitor logs and Aurora performance metrics** post-upgrade for any regressions.
