# PRD Review

## üìù Instructions
Review the following PRD and identify **3 critical issues**.

## Example PRD
### Feature: User Profile Management
1. Users should be able to update their name and email.
2. There is no authentication mechanism specified.
3. No mention of error handling.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Your Review

- Issue 1: No Clear Objective

The document does not specify the purpose of the User Profile Management feature. A PRD should define why the feature is needed and what problems it aims to solve. Without this, teams lack direction and alignment.

- Issue 2: Missing Technical Considerations

There is no mention of authentication mechanisms, API dependencies, or data validation. This omission can lead to security risks (e.g., unauthorised profile updates) and unclear technical implementation.

- Issue 3: No UX/UI Considerations

The PRD does not include wireframes, form validation rules, or user flow details. How will users experience profile updates? Will there be confirmation messages or error handling? These details are crucial for a smooth user experience.

üîç Additional Missing Components
Success Metrics: How will the team measure the effectiveness of the feature? (e.g., user adoption rate, error reduction)
Timeline & Milestones: No delivery dates or development phases are outlined
