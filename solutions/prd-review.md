# PRD Review

## üìù Instructions
Review the following PRD and identify **3 critical issues**.

## Example PRD
### Feature: User Profile Management
1. Users should be able to update their name and email.
2. There is no authentication mechanism specified.
3. No mention of error handling.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Your Review

- **Issue 1: Lack of Clear Objectives & User Stories**  

  The PRD does not define the purpose of the User Profile Management feature or include user stories outlining the **Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)**. Without this, teams may struggle to understand the problem being solved and how it impacts users. Clear user stories should provide context and direction for development.

- **Issue 2: No Acceptance Criteria**  

  The document lacks **acceptance criteria**, making it impossible to validate whether the feature works as intended. Without well-defined conditions for success, testing, validation, and stakeholder alignment become challenging. Acceptance criteria should cover expected behaviors, error scenarios, and edge cases.

- **Issue 3: Missing Technical & UX Considerations**  

  There is no mention of authentication mechanisms, error handling, or UI/UX design elements such as form validation and user flows. This omission can lead to security vulnerabilities (e.g., unauthorised profile updates) and a poor user experience. The PRD should specify how users interact with the feature, including error messaging, validation rules, and success confirmations.

üîç **Additional Missing Components**  
- **Success Metrics**: How will the team measure the feature‚Äôs impact? (e.g., user adoption rate, error reduction)  
- **Timeline & Milestones**: No delivery dates or development phases are outlined
